# Snappic Pi Print Server

This project's goal is to reproduce the Snappic Print Server available for MacOS and Windows and make it compatible with a Raspberry Pi. into a local print server compatible with Snappic and a QW410 printer. It displays a config UI, and a CUPS + Gutenprint integration.

## Features

- üì° Bonjour / Avahi service discovery (`Photobooth Print Server`)
- üì∏ HTTP POST `/print/image` endpoint for Snappic iPad app
- üñ®Ô∏è Prints via CUPS + Gutenprint (DNP QW410 supported)
- üß∞ Configuration UI available on screen or at http://192.168.1.72:3000 (for some reasons I couldn't make it work on Chrome so it's Safari only)

## Getting Started

### 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Bookworm)

Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), enable SSH if headless.

### 2. Set up the server

Connect to your Raspi via SSH and upload the repo. You can use the script deploy-include.sh in the scripts folder.
Then launch the setup.sh script from scripts folder on your pi.
You might need some admin rights

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

After setup, the Pi will reboot automatically.
All services will start on launch.

### 3. Connect iPad to same network (Ethernet or AP)

Snappic app should auto-discover the server.

### 4. Config access

Go to http://192.168.1.72:3000 on the connected device to access the printer config and test print interface.
Don't forget to adjust the config depending on your project.

### 5. CUPS Interface

CUPS admin panel is accessible on port http://192.168.1.72:631. Here you'll be able to configure new printers.

### 5. Let's go!

Select the Photobooth Print Server printer available in the list and start your booth session as usual.

## üîß `config.json` (autogenerated, no need to include manually)

But if you want a default placeholder for initial setup:

```json
{
  "printer": "",
  "margins": {
    "top": 0,
    "right": 0,
    "bottom": 0,
    "left": 0
  },
  "transpose": false,
  "paperSize": "4x6"
}
```

## Material

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)
- DNP QW410 printer
- iPad (7th generation) + Snappic iPad app
- Mac or Windows computer + Raspberry Pi Imager app
- 64GB SanDisk microSD card
- SD Card reader USB-B
- USB-C power supply
- RJ45 Ethernet cable
- Lightning to RJ45/USB-B/Lightning OTG adapter
- ABS case

## Why?

In 2024, my husband and I built a DIY photobooth for our wedding. You can read the full story, including the budget, in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photobooth/comments/1h7wvbn/building_a_diy_photobooth_my_experience_lessons/).

One of the main challenges we faced was that our venue had no Wi-Fi access and nearly no 4G, so we needed a fully offline setup. We chose Snappic for its flexibility and customization options, and paired it with a DNP QW410 printer for its compact size, although it lacks native AirPrint support.

The only way to get this combination working with the Snappic iPad app was to use their official print server, which is only available for macOS and Windows. We ended up buying a mini PC just to run it. But that solution felt heavy and unnecessarily complex: Windows was slow, bloated, and error-prone for something that should‚Äôve been plug-and-play.

As friends started asking to borrow our photobooth, I wanted to build something more compact, reliable, and headless, ideally running on a Raspberry Pi without sacrificing print speed.

This project is the result: a lightweight Raspberry Pi-based print server that mimics the behavior of the official Snappic Print Server, includes a web-based config UI, and supports the DNP QW410. I figured it might be useful to others using the same kind of setup.
